short description: This app allows a user to create an account/login. Then, it is able to get the user's data from the backend and display its tasks onto the task list. 
If they want to add something, they can post it using the text box at the end. 
There are multiple screens so the app has 2 view controllers which push and pop each other. The task list is a scrollable view. The ability to display old tasks and post 
new tasks uses networking.
